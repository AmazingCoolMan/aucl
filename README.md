# aucl
Among Us Chat Logger


I started working on this project after I've read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/REGames/comments/jxew91/would_it_be_possible_to_extract_chat_messages/).
I wanted to help him because I think he really has good intentions and I needed a new project to work on. (and I really hope this will be just used with good intentions.)
I gladly appreciate any pr or other type of help to make this project and the dream of this reddit user possible. =)
